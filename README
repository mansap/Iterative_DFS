Foundations of Intelligent Systems
Assignment 1 Programming Question
(R. Zanibbi)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files in this directory:

SearchGraph.py:  The file to modify for the assignment.
romania:         Text file defining adjacent cities in the map of Romania.
test:            Automated test script. Runs SearchGraph.py with predefined arguments.
                 You should modify this script when testing your program.

Making 'test' executable on the CS computers (i.e. in Unix/Linux):

  1. Go to the directory containing the code for Assignment 1.
  2. Issue the following command:

        chmod u+x test
     
     This will make 'test' executable for you, the 'u'ser. 
	 
     Running this command tells Linux to look for the "#!/bin/bash" command at
     the top of the file, which runs 'bash' shell and then treats the rest of
     the file as input to the shell, and then exits when this ‘shell script’ ends.
